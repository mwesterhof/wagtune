# TODO

* [X] temporarily bypass the post-save signal for redirect creation (thanks, wagtail)
* [X] end date should be editable after creation
* [ ] create/close on root levels breaks site root, handle more elegantly or forbid a/b tests on root
* [ ] look into preserving the original pk during create/close
